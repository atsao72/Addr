Gone are the days where you could give someone your phone number and expect to be fully connected.

Nowadays, people have an average of 5 social media accounts. These accounts are meant to keep us more connected than ever, but the process of finding all of someone's social media accounts is something that can get annoying, especially when the number of accounts is constantly growing

With Addr, you can exchange all of your social media accounts with your new friend with just a simple QR scan! Now, having so many accounts isn't going to be a hassle, and we can start using those accounts to actually stay connected.
